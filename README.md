# react-tastic

A straightforward, robust development environment (scaffold) for rapid prototyping, testing, & launch of new react applications/components.

## Set up

* Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository url>`.
* Install packages: `npm install`. (assumes nodejs installed on machine)
* Build & run development server: `npm start`. (assumes python v3 installed on machine for actual server command)
* Modify `src/index.js`, substituting the example App component for any component you want.
* Now you can instantly start writing your new React components & sass within the src/ directory...
    * No further setup required (unless you want to, of course)!
* (Optional) declare a 'SRC_DIR' variable, and 'TEST_DIR' variable
    - Set these environment variables in a `.env` file you create
    - Use the `.env-example` file as an example for `.env`
